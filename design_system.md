# Design System

## Abstract

The following design system amplifies a person's physical relationship to an "infinite 2d canvas" (Scott McCloud, Brenda Laurel) through the fundamentals of print media and theater.

Interactions with the 2d canvas are encouraged with affordances rather than abstracted skeumorphs.

## The challenge space

The web coordinates an unthinkable amount of interactivity. But our variety of physical input is fairly sandboxed and safe. We're limited to keyboards, mice, gamepads, voice-to-text; maybe hardware sensors with permission?

I think we can design around a few broad affordances:
What is press-able
what is text-able
what is effect-able

Can I press this? Is it a text input? What happens after?

Admittidly reductive but the simplicity is earnest and creates a similarly simple design language.

Wireframe delivers a design token system where interactive affordances make up the majority of the API surface.

There's an inverse relationship to specificity and token number:

- interactive affordances (most used, most tokens)
- document propreties (next most used, less tokens)
- skeumorphic components (most specific, least tokens)

# Influences

Wireframe is influenced by my time at Material and a few authors, namely Scott McClound and Brenda Laurel.
