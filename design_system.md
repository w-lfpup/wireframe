# Design System

## Abstract

A design system should focus on a the physical relationship a person has to an "infinite 2d canvas" (Scott McCloud, Brenda Laurel).

2d planar surfaces are best served by fundamentals of theater and print media rather than skeumorphic design.

## Summary

The following bullet points outline the general millue of this design system.

- A Taxonomy of affordances (not components)
- A "computers as theater" approach. Human computer interactions (actor) across an infinite 2d canvas (theater)
- No motion without utilty
- No compound components

Wireframe is influenced by my time at Material and a few authors, namely Scott McClound and Brenda Laurel.
