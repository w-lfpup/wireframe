# Wireframe

Wireframe is a radically simple design system and component set for the web.

It serves to prove three objectives:

A design system should focus on a the physical relationship a person has to an "infinite 2d canvas" (Scott McCloud, Brenda Laurel).

Components should be built using first principals of a target platform; in this case, for the web.

It's a 'wireframe' developers can use to model their own resilient, mission critical web UIs.
