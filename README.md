# Wireframe

Wireframe is a radically simple design system and component set for the web.

It serves to prove three objectives:

A design system should focus on a the physical relationship a person has to an "infinite 2d canvas" (Scott McCloud, Brenda Laurel).

Components should be built using first principals of a target platform; in this case, for the web.

2d planar surfaces are best served by fundamentals of print media instead of the current neo-skeumorphism zeitgeist in th 2020s.

In a way, it's a 'wireframe' developers can use to model their own resilient, mission critical UIs for the web
